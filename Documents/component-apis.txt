 Component API Definitions
---------------------------

The objective of this document is to clearly define the functionality of each
component of the robot. The robot is currently composed of three primary
components or modules:

- the client machine, which allows the client to specify and start a task
- the arm, a potentially interchangable appendage for plant interactions
- the frame, which moves the arm to the necessary position for interactions

And the hierarchy of these modules is as follows.

        ----------
        | client |
        ----------
          /    \
         /      \
 ---------      ---------
 | frame |      |  arm  |
 ---------      ---------


 Client machine -- arm API
---------------------------

Possible messages from client machine to arm:
 - start(int x): arm begins enumerated action sequence #x
 - get_status(): poll arm for success/fail/in-progress state

 Client machine -- frame API
-----------------------------

Possible messages from client machine to frame:
 - go(int x, int y): frame moves to coordinates (x, y)
 - get_position(): poll frame for current coordinates
